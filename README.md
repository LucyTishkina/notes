# notes

Here you will find notes from ComptiaNetwork+ and ComptiaSecurity+ courses from Professor Messer on YouTube.

I have posted the original CherryTree documents as well as html exports. To preview the html export you can prepend https://htmlpreview.github.io/? to any html file. For example, to preview the index with all the course contents for ComptiaNetwork+ use https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LucyTishkina/notes/blob/main/Notes_CompTIASecurity%2B/index.html
