<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Wireless Network Troubleshooting</h1><br/>Reflection<br />- wireless signals can bounce off some surfaces (ie. metal, desks)<br />   → depends on the frequencies and the surfaces<br />- too much reflection can weaken the signal<br />   → a little multipath interference actually helps MIMO<br />- position antennas to avoid excessive reflection<br />   → may not be a problem for MIMO in 802.11n and 802.11ac<br /><br />Refraction<br />- signal passes through an object and exits at a different angle<br />   → similar to light through water<br />- data rates are affected <br />   → signal is less directional<br />- outdoor long-distance wireless links<br />   → changes in the air temperatures and water vapor<br /><br />Absorption<br />- signal passes through an object and loses signal strength<br />   → especially though walls and windows<br />- different objects absorb differently as frequencies change<br />   → 2.4 GHz may have less absorption than 5 GHz<br />- put the antennas on the ceiling<br />   → and avoid going through walls<br /><br />Latency and jitter<br />- latency<br />   → delay between transmission and reception<br />- jitter<br />   → deviation from a predictable data stream<br />- wireless interference and signal issues<br />   → slower data rates<br />   → incresae in retransmissions<br />- capacity issues<br />   → many people using the same wireless frequencies<br /><br />Attenuation<br />- wireless signals get weaker as you move farther from the antenna<br />   → the attenuation can be measured with a Wi-Fi analyzer<br />- control the power output on the access point <br />   → not always an option<br />- use a receive antenna with a higher gain<br />   → capture more of the signal<br />- move closer to the antenna<br />   → may not be possible<br /><br />Interference<br />- something else is using the same frequencies<br />- predictable<br />   → fluorescent lights, microwave ovens, cordless telephones, high-power sources<br />- unpredictable<br />   → multi-tenant building<br />- measurements<br />   → netstat -e<br />   → Performance Monitor<br /><br />Incorrect antenna type<br />- the antenna must fit the room<br />   → or the distance between sender and receiver<br />- omnidirectional<br />   → useful on the ceiling<br />   → not very useful between buildings<br />- directional<br />   → used often between two points<br />   → or on a wall mounted access point<br />- the access point may provide options<br />   → connect different antennas<br /><br />Incorrect antenna placement<br />- interference<br />   → overlapping channels<br />- slow throughput<br />   → data fighting to be heard through the interference<br />- check access point locations and channel settings<br />   → a challenge for 2.4 GHz<br />   → much easier for 5 GHz<br /><br />Overcapacity<br />- device saturation<br />   → too many devices on one wireless network<br />   → there are only so many frequencies<br />   → the 5GHz can really help with this<br />- bandwidth saturation<br />   → large data transfers<br />- common in large meeting places<br />   → conferences<br />   → airports<br />   → hotels<br /><br />Frequency mismatch<br />- Devices have to match the access point<br />   → 2.4 GHz, 5GHz<br />- verify the client is communicating over the correct channel<br />   → this is normally done automatically<br />   → may not operate correctly if manually configured<br />- older standards may slow down the newer network<br />   → 802.11b compatability mode on 802.11n networks<br /><br />Wrong SSID<br />- every access point has at least one Service Set Identifier (SSID)<br />   → but did you connect to the right one?<br />- this can be more confusing than you might think<br />   → Public Wi-Fi Internet<br />   → Guest Internet<br />   → Internet<br />- confirm the correct SSID settings<br />   → should be listed in the current connection status<br /><br />Wrong passphrase<br />- wireless authentication<br />   → many different methods<br />- required to connect to the wireless network<br />   → if not connected, check the authentication<br />- shared passphrase<br />   → common in a SOHO, not in the enterprise<br />- 802.1X<br />   → used for the enterprise<br />   → make sure the client is configured to use 802.1X<br /><br />Security type mismatch<br />- encryption on wireless is important<br />   → make sure the client matches the access point<br />- this is much easier these days<br />   → almost everything is at the level of WPA2<br />- some legacy equipment may not be able to keep up<br />   → if you change the access point, you may not be able to support it<br />- Migrate all of your WEP to WPA2<br />   → and any WPA<br /><br />Signal to noise ration<br />- signal<br />   → what you want<br />- noise<br />   → what you don't want<br />   → interference from other networks and devices<br />- you want a very large ration<br />   → the same amount of signal to noise (1:1) would be bad<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br
