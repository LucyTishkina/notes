<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Wired Network Troubleshooting</h1><br/>Signal loss<br />- usually gradual<br />   → signal strength diminishes over distance<br />- attenuation<br />   → loss of intensity as signal, moves through a medium<br />- electrical signals through copper, light through fiber<br />   → radio waves through air<br /><br />Decibel (dB)<br />- signal strength ratio measurements<br />   → one-tenth of bel<br />   → capital B for Alexander Graham Bell<br />- Logarithmic scale<br />   → add and subtract losses and gains<br />- 3 dB = 2x the signal<br />- 10 dB = 10x the signal<br />- 20 dB = 100x the signal<br />- 30 dB  = 1000x the signal<br /><br />dB loss symptoms<br />- no connectivity<br />   → no signal<br />- intermittent connectivity<br />   → just enough signal to sync the link<br />- poor performance<br />   → signal too weak<br />   → CRC errors, data corruption<br />- test each connection<br />   → test distance and signal loss (TDR, OTDR)<br /><br />Latency<br />- a delay between the request and the response<br />   → waiting time<br />- some latency is expected and normal<br />   → laws of physics apply<br />- examine the response times at every step along the way<br />   → this may require multiple measurement tools<br />- packet captures can provide detailed analysis<br />   → microsecond granularity<br />   → get cpatures from both sides<br /><br />Jitter<br />- most real-time media is sensitive to delay<br />   → data should arrive at regular intervals<br />   → voice communication, live video<br />- if you miss a packet, there's no retransmission<br />   → there's no time to “rewind” your phone call<br />- jitter is the time between frames<br />   → excessive jitter can cause you to miss information, “choppy” voice calls<br /><br />Troubleshooting excessive jitter<br />- confirm available bandwidth<br />   → nothing will work well if the tube is clogged<br />- make sure the infrastructure is working as expected<br />   → check queues in your switched and routers<br />   → no dropped frames<br />- apply QoS <br />   → prioritize real-time communication services<br />   → switch, router, firewall ,etc.<br /><br />Crosstalk (XT)<br />- signal on one circuit affects another circuit<br />   → in a bad way<br />- leaking of signal<br />   → you can sometimes “hear” the leak<br />- measure XT with a TDR<br />   → some training may be required<br />- Near End Crosstalk (NEXT)<br />   → interference measured at the transmitting end<br />      ⇒ the near end<br />- Far End Crosstalk (FEXT)<br />   → interference measured away from the transmitter<br /><br />Troubleshooting crosstalk<br />- almost always a wiring issue<br />   → check your crimp<br />- maintain your twists<br />   → the twist helps avoid crosstalk<br />- category 6A increases cable diameter<br />   → increased distance between pairs<br />- test and certify your installation<br />   → solve problems before they are problems<br /><br />Avoiding EMI and interference<br />- electromagnetic interference<br />- cable handling<br />   → no twisting - don't pull or stretch<br />   → watch your bend radius<br />   → don't use staples, watch your cable ties<br />- EMI and interference with copper cables<br />   → avoid power cords, fluorescent lights, electrical systems, and fire prevention components<br />- test after installation<br />   → you find most of your problems before use<br /><br />Opens and shorts<br />- a short circuit<br />   → two connections are touching<br />   → wires inside of a cable or connection<br />- An open circuit<br />   → a break in the connection<br />- Complete interruption<br />   → can be intermittent<br /><br />Troubleshooting opens and shorts<br />- May be difficult to find<br />   → the wire has to be moved just the right way<br />   → wiggle it here and there<br />- Replace the cable with the short or open<br />   → difficult or impossible to repair<br />- Advanced troubleshooting with a TDR<br /><br />Troubleshooting pin-outs<br />- cables can foul up a perfectly good plan<br />   → test your cables prior to implementation<br />- many connectors look alike<br />   → do you have a good cable mapping device?<br />- get a good cable person<br />   → it's an art<br /><br />T568A and T568B termination<br />- Pin assignments from EI/TIA-568-B standard<br />   → eight conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted-pair cabling<br />- T568A and T568B are different pin assignments for 8P8C connectors<br />   → assigns the T568A pin-out to horizontal cabling (on the same floor)<br />- many organizations traditionally use 568B<br />   → difficult to change mid-stream<br />- you can't terminate one side of the cable with 568A and the other with 568B<br />   → it won't be a straight-through cable<br /><br />Incorrect cable type<br />- excessive physical errors, CRC errors<br />   → check your Layer 1 first<br />- check the outside of the cable<br />   → usually printed on the outside<br />   → may also have length marks printed<br />- confirm the cable specifications with a TDR<br />   → advanced cable tester can identify damaged cables<br /><br />Troubleshooting interfaces<br />- interface errors<br />   → may indicate bad cable or hardware problem<br />- verify configurations<br />   → speed, duplex, VLAN, etc.<br />- verify two-way traffic<br />   → end-to-end connectivity<br /><br />Transceiver mismatch<br />- transceivers have to match the fiber<br />   → single mode transceiver connects to single mode fiber<br />- transceiver needs to match the wavelength<br />   → 850nm, 1310nm, etc.<br />- use the correct transceivers and optical fiber<br />   → check the entire link<br />- signal loss<br />   → dropped frames, missing frames<br /><br />Reversing transmit and receive<br />- wiring mistake<br />   → cable ends<br />   → punchdowns<br />- easy to find with a wire map<br />   → 1-3, 2-6, 3-1, 6-2<br />   → simple to identify<br />- some network interfaces will automatically correct (Auto-MDIX)<br /><br />TX/RX reversal troubleshooting<br />- no connectivity<br />   → Auto-MDIX might connect<br />   → try turning it on<br />- Locate reversal location<br />   → often at punchdown<br />   → check your patch panel<br /><br />Damaged cables<br />- copper cables are pretty rugged<br />   → but they aren't indestructible<br />- cables can be out in the open<br />   → stepped on, folded between a table and a wall<br />- check your physical layer<br />   → cables should not be bent or folded<br />   → check for any bent pins on the device<br />- it's difficult to see inside of the cable<br />   → check your TDR, replace the cable (if possible)<br /><br />Bottlenecks<br />- there's never just one performance metric<br />   → a series of technologies working together<br />- I/O bus, CPU speed, storage access speed, network throughput, etc.<br />   → one of these can slow all of the others down<br />- you must monitor all of them to find the slowest one<br />   → this may be more difficult than you might expect<br /><br />Resolving the network bottleneck<br />- knowing baselines can help identify problems<br /><br />Interface configuration problems<br />- poor throughput<br />   → very consistent, easily reproducible<br />- no connectivity <br />   → no link light<br />- no connectivity<br />   → link light and activity light<br /><br />Interface configuration<br />- Auto vs Manual configuration<br />   → personal preference<br />- light status<br />   → no light, no connection<br />- speed<br />   → must be identical on both sides<br />- duplex<br />   → if mismatched, speed will suffer<br />   → increase in late collisions<br /><br />VLAN mismatch<br />- switch is configured with the incorrect VLAN<br />   → configured per switch interface<br />- link light, but no surfing<br />   → A DHCP IP address may not be on the correct subnet<br />   → manually IP addressing won't work at all<br />- Check the switch configuration for VLAN configuration<br />   → Each port should have a VLAN setting<br />   → VLAN 1 is usually the default<br /><br />Duplex/speed mismatch<br />- speed and duplex<br />   → Speed 10/100/1000/Auto<br />   → Duplex Half/Full/Auto<br />- incorrect speed<br />   → many switch configurations will auto-negotiate speed<br />   → less than expected throughspeed<br />- incorrect duplex<br />   → again, the switch may auto-negotiate<br />   → needs to match on both sides<br />   → a mismatch will cause significant slowdowns<br />   → increase in late collisions may indicate a duplex mismatch<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br
