<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Networking Devices</h1><br/>Hub<br />- “multi-port repeater”<br />   → traffic going in one port is repeated to every other port<br />   → OSI Layer 1<br />- Everything is half-duplex<br />- becomes less efficient as network speeds increase (more collisions)<br />- 10 megabit/100 megabit<br />- difficult to find today<br /><br />Bridge<br />- imagine a switch with 2-4 ports<br />   → makes forwarding decisions in software<br />- connects different physical networks<br />   → can connect different topologies<br />   → gets around physical network size limitations/collisions<br />- OSI Layer 2 device<br />   → Distributes traffic based on MAC address<br />- An example of a modern bridges is a wireless access point<br />   → Bridges wired Ethernet to wireless<br /><br />Switch<br />- Bridging done in hardware<br />   → application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)<br />- An OSI Layer 2 device<br />   → forwards traffic based on MAC address<br />- Many ports and features<br />   → the core of an enterprise network<br />   → may provide Power over Ethernet (PoE)<br />- Multilayer switch<br />   → Includes Layer 3 (routing) functionality<br /><br />Router<br />- Routes traffic between IP subnets<br />   → OSI Layer 3 device<br />   → Routers inside of switches sometimes called “layer 3 switches”<br />   → Layer 2 = Switch<br />   → Layer 3 = Router<br />- Often connects diverse network types<br />   → LAN, WAN, copper, fiber<br /><br />Firewall<br />- Filters traffic by port number<br />   → OSI Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)<br />      ⇒ some firewalls can filter through OSI Layer 7 (looking at the application)<br />- Can encrypt traffic into/out of the network (VPN endpoint)<br />   → protect your traffic between sites<br />- Can proxy traffic<br />   → A common security technique<br />- Most firewalls can be layer 3 devices (routers)<br />   → Usually sits on the ingress/egress of the network<br /><br />Wireless Access Point (WAP)<br />- not a wireless router<br />   → a wireless router is a router and a WAP in a single device<br />- WAP is a bridge<br />   → Extends the wired network onto the wireless network<br />   → WAP is an OSI Layer 2 device<br /><br />Modem<br />- Modulator/Demotulator<br />   → Converts analog sounds to digital sounds<br />   → Need a modem on both sides of the connection<br />- Uses standard phone lines<br />   → limited frequencies, limited bandwidths<br />- POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) modems now used for backup and utility functions (backup communication)<br />- ADSL modems used for Internet access<br />- Cable modem is bridge (for broadband Internet)<br /><br />Converting media<br />- OSI Layer 1<br />   → physical layer signal conversion<br />- extend a copper wire over a long distance<br />   → convert it to fiber and back again<br />- you have fiber<br />   → the switch only has copper ports<br />- almost always powered<br />   → especially fiber to copper<br /><br />Wireless range extender<br />- Wireless never seems to stretch far enough<br />   → we can't always choose where to install an access point<br />- Extend the reach of a wireless network<br />   → a wireless repeater<br /><br />VoIP endpoint<br />- some people still communicate using voice<br />   → these old people can now use phones with VoIP<br />- the device can now be anything<br />   → traditional phone handset<br />   → desktop application<br />   → mobile device app<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
