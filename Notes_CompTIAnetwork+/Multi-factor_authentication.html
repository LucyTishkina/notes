<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Multi-factor authentication</h1><br/>Multi-factor authentication<br />- more than one factor<br />   → something you are<br />   → something you have<br />   → something you know<br />   → something you are<br />   → something you do<br />- can be expensive<br />   → separate hardware tokens<br />   → specialized scanning equipment<br />- can be inexpensive<br />   → free smartphone applications<br /><br />Something you know<br />- password<br />   → secret word/phrase, string of characters<br />   → very common authentication factor<br />- PIN<br />   → Personal Identification Number<br />   → not typically contained anywhere on a smart card or ATM card<br />- Pattern<br />   → complete a series of patterns<br />   → only you know the right format<br /><br />Something you have<br />- smart card<br />   → integrates with devices<br />   → may require a PIN<br />- USB token<br />   → certificate is on the USB device<br />- Hardware or software tokens<br />   → generates pseudo-random authentication codes<br />- your phone<br />   → SMS a code to your phone<br /><br />Something you are<br />- Biometric authentication<br />   → fingerprint, iris scan, voiceprint<br />- usually stores a mathematical representation of your biometrics<br />   → your actual fingerprint isn't usually saved<br />- difficult to change<br />   → you can change your password<br />   → you can't change your fingerprint<br />- used in very specific situations<br />   → not foolproof<br /><br />Somewhere you are<br />- provide a factor based on your location<br />   → the transaction only completes if you are in a particular geography<br />- IP address<br />   → Not perfect, but can help provide more info<br />   → Works with IPv4, not so much with IPv6<br />- Mobile device location services<br />   → geolocation to a very specific area<br />   → must be in a location that can receive GPS information or near an identified mobile or 802.11 network<br />   → still not a perfect identifier of location<br /><br />Something you do<br />- a personal way of doing things<br />   → you're special<br />- handwriting analysis<br />   → signature comparison<br />   → writing technique<br />- typing technique<br />   → delays between keystrokes<br />- very similar to biometrics<br />   → close to something you are<br /></div></body></html>
