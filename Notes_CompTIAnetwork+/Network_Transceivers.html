<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Network Transceivers</h1><br/>Transciever<br />- transmitter and receiver<br />   → usually in a single component<br />- provides a modular interface<br />   → add the transceiver that matches your network<br />- many different types and designs<br /><br />Duplex communications<br />- two fibers<br />   → transmit and receive<br /><br />Bi-Directional (BiDi) Transceivers<br />- traffic in both directions with a single fiber<br />   → use two different wavelengths<br />- reduce number of fiber runs by half<br /><br />GBIC<br />- Gigabit Interface Converter<br />   → an early transceiver standard<br />- Common on Gigabit and fibre channel networks<br />   → copper and fiber support<br />- Relatively large<br />   → and effectively replaced by SFPs<br /><br />SFP and SFP+<br />- Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP)<br />   → commonly used to provide 1 Gbit/s fiber<br />   → 1 Gbit/s RJ45 SFPs also available<br />- Enhanced Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP+)<br />   → exactly the same size as SFPs<br />   → supports data rates up to 16 Gbit/s<br />   → common with 10 Gigabit Ethernet<br /><br />QSFP<br />- Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable<br />   → 4-channel SFp = Four 1 Gbit/s = 4 Gbit/s<br />   → QSFP+ is four-channel SFP+ = Four 10 Gbit/sec = 40 Gbit/sec<br />- Combine four SFPs into a single transceiver<br />   → cost savings in fiber and equipment<br />- Bi-Directional (BiDi) QSFP and QSFP+<br />   → additional efficiency over a single fiber run<br /><br /></div></body></html>
