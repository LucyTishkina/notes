<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Static and Dynamic Routing</h1><br/>Routing<br />- Send IP packets across the network<br />   → forwarding decisions are on based on destination IP address<br />- Each router only knows the next step<br />   → the packet asks for directions every hop along the way<br />   → the list of directions is held in a routing table<br /><br />Static Routing<br />- administratively define the routes<br />   → you're in control<br />- Advantages<br />   → easy to configure and manage on smaller networks<br />   → no overhead from routing protocols (CPU, memory, bandwidth)<br />   → easy to configure on sub networks (only one way out)<br />   → more secure - no routing protocols to analyze<br />- Disadvantages<br />   → difficult to administer on larger networks<br />   → no automatic method to prevent routing loops<br />   → if there's a network change, you have to manually update the routes<br />   → no automatic rerouting if an outage occurs<br /><br />Dynamic routing<br />- routers send routes to other routers<br />   → routing tables are updated in (almost) real-time<br />- advantages<br />   → no manual route calculations or management<br />   → new routes are populated automatically<br />   → very scalable<br />- disadvantages<br />   → some routes overhead required (CPU, memory, bandwidth)<br />   → requires some initial configuration to work properly<br /><br />Default route<br />- A route when no other route matches<br />   → the “gateway of last resort”<br />- a remote site may have only one route<br />   → go that way -&gt; rest of the world<br />- can dramatically simplify the routing process<br />   → works in conjunction with all other routing methods</div></body></html>
