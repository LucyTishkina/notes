<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Physical Security Controls</h1><br/>Proper lighting<br />- More light means more security<br />   → bad guys avoid the light<br />   → easier to see when lit<br />   → Non IR cameras see better<br />- Specialized design<br />   → consider overall light levels<br />   → lighting angles may be important<br />      ⇒ facial recognition<br />   → avoid shadows and glare<br /><br />Signs<br />- clear and specific instructions<br />   → keep people away from restricted areas<br />   → consider visitors<br />- consider personal safety<br />   → fire exits<br />   → warning signs<br />      ⇒ chemicals<br />      ⇒ construction<br />   → medical resources<br />- informational<br />   → in case of emergency, call this number<br /><br />Fencing<br />- build a perimeter<br />   → usually very obvious<br />   → may not be what you're looking for<br />- transparent or opaque<br />   → see though the fence (or not)<br />- robust<br />   → difficult to cut the fence<br />- prevent climbing<br />   → razor wire<br />   → build it high<br /><br />Rack monitoring and security<br />- monitoring systems<br />   → environmental sensors<br />   → webcams<br />   → integration with enterprise monitoring systems<br />- security<br />   → closed racks<br />   → locks (with keys!)<br />   → fences and gates<br /><br />Guards and access lists<br />- security guard<br />   → physical protection<br />   → validates identification of existing employees<br />   → provides guest access<br />- ID badge<br />   → picture, name, other details<br />   → must be worn at all times<br />- access list<br />   → physical list of names<br />   → enforced by security guard<br /><br />Alarms<br />- circuit-based<br />   → circuit is opened or closed<br />   → door, window, fence<br />   → useful on the perimeter<br />- motion detection<br />   → radio reflection or passive infrared<br />   → useful in areas not often in use<br />- duress<br />   → triggered by a person<br />   → the big red button<br /><br />Safe<br />- secure your important hardware and media<br />   → backups, laptops, hard drives<br />- protection against the elements<br />   → fire, water<br />- difficult to steal<br />   → very heavy<br />- must be carefully managed<br />   → don't share the combination<br />   → what happens when you lose the combination?<br /><br />Locking cabinets<br />- data center hardware is often managed by different groups<br />   → responsibility lies with the owner<br />- racks can be installed together<br />   → side-to-sides<br />- enclosed cabinets with locks<br />   → ventilation on front, back, top, and bottom<br /><br />Protected distribution<br />- Protected Distribution System (PDS)<br />   → a physically secure cabled network<br />- protect your cables and fibers<br />   → all of the data flows through these circuits<br />- prevent cable and fiber taps<br />   → direct taps and inductive taps<br />- prevent cable and fiber cuts<br />   → a physical denial of service (DoS)<br />- hardened protected distribution system<br />   → sealed metal conduit, periodic visual inspection<br /><br />Air gap<br />- physical separation between networks<br />   → secure network and insecure network<br />   → separate customer infrastructures<br />- most environments are shared<br />   → shared routers, switches, firewalls<br />   → some of these are virtualized<br />- specialized networks require air gaps<br />   → stock market networks<br />   → power systems/SCADA<br />   → airplanes<br />   → nuclear power plant operations<br /><br />Mantraps<br />- all doors normally unlocked<br />   → opening one door causes the other to lock<br />- all doors normally locked<br />   → unlocking one door prevents others from being unlocked<br />- one door open / other locked<br />   → when one is open, the other cannot be unlocked<br />- one at a time, controlled groups<br />   → managed control through an area<br /><br />Faraday cage<br />- blocks electromagnetic fields<br />   → discovered by Michael Faraday in 1836<br />- a mesh of conductive material<br />   → the cage cancels the electromagnetic field's effect on the interior<br />   → the window of a microwave oven<br />- not a comprehensive solution<br />   → not all signal types are blocked<br />   → some signal types are not blocked at all<br />- can restrict access to mobile networks<br />   → some very specific contingencies would need to be in place for emergency calls<br /><br />Door access controls<br />- conventional<br />   → lock and key<br />- deadbolt<br />   → physical bolt<br />- electronic<br />   → keyless<br />- token-based<br />   → magnetic swipe card or proximity reader<br />- multi-factor<br />   → smart card and PIN<br /><br />Biometrics<br />- you are the authentication factor<br />   → fingerprint, iris, voiceprint<br />- usually stores a mathematical representation of your biometrics<br />   → your actual fingerprint isn't usually saved<br />- difficult to change<br />   → you can change your password<br />   → you can't change your fingerprint<br />- used in very specific situations<br />   → not foolproof<br /><br />Barricades / bollards<br />- prevent access<br />   → there are limits to the prevention<br />- channel people through a specific access point<br />   → and keep out other things<br />   → allow people, prevent cars and trucks<br />- identify safety concerns<br />   → and prevent injuries<br />- can be used to an extreme<br />   → concrete barriers / bollards<br />   → moats<br /><br />Tokens and cards<br />- smart card<br />   → integrates with devices<br />   → may require a PIN<br />- USB token<br />   → certificate is on the USB device<br />- hardware or software tokens / key fobs<br />   → generates pseudo-random authentication codes<br />- your phone<br />   → SMS a code to your phone<br /><br />HVAC<br />- Heating, Ventilation and AC<br />   → thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer<br />- a complex science<br />   → not something you can properly design yourself<br />   → must be integrated into the fire system<br />- data center should be separate from the rest of the building<br />   → not too cold, not too hot<br />   → overheating is a huge issue<br />- closed-loop recirculating and positive pressurization<br />   → recycle internal air, and air is pushed out<br />- hot and cold aisles<br />   → push cold air through racks<br />   → push hot air back through HVAC to cool<br /><br />Fire suppression<br />- electronics require unique responses to fire<br />   → water is generally a bad thing<br />- detection<br />   → smoke detector, flame detector, heat detector<br />- suppress with water<br />   → where appropriate<br />- suppress with chemicals<br />   → halon - no longer manufactured<br />      ⇒ destroys ozone<br />   → commonly replaced with Dupont FM-200<br /><br />Cable locks<br />- temporary security<br />   → connect your hardware to something solid<br />- cable works almost anywhere<br />   → useful when mobile<br />- most devices have a standard connector<br />   → reinforced notch<br />- not designed for long-term protection<br />   → those cables are pretty thin<br /><br />Screen filters<br />- control your input<br />   → be aware of your surroundings<br />- use privacy filters<br />   → it's amazing how well they work<br />- keep your monitor out of sight<br />   → away from windows and hallways<br />- don't sit in front of me on your flight<br />   → I can't help myself<br /><br />Video surveillance<br />- CCTV / IP-based cameras<br />   → can replaced physical guards<br />- Camera properties are important<br />   → Focal-length - shorter is wider angle<br />   → Depth of field - how much is in focus<br />   → Illumination req's - See in the dark<br />- Often many different cameras<br />   → networked together and recorded over time<br /><br />Logs<br />- everything is logged<br />   → entering the parking area<br />   → identification upon entering the building<br />   → badge assignment tracks door operation<br />- correlate physical location with digital access<br />   → someone logged into the console while in the room<br />- need a formal process to collect and archive log information<br />   → some of the logs are physical, some are digital<br />   → may fall under privacy laws<br /><br />Key management<br />- physical or digital keys<br />   → protect important access<br />- key generation<br />   → a formal process to generate access keys<br />   → checks and balances<br />- key breaches<br />   → unauthorized use<br />   → what happens when a key is compromised?<br />- create policies with best-practices<br />   → control your physical security<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br
