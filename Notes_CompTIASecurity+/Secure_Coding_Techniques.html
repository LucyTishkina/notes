<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Secure Coding Techniques</h1><br/>Secure coding concepts<br />- a balance between time and quality<br />   → programming with security in mind is often secondary<br />- testing, testing, testing<br />   → the Quality Assurance (QA) process<br />- vulnerabilities will eventually be found<br />   → and exploited<br /><br />Error and exception handling<br />- what happens when an error occurs?<br />   → “graceful” exceptions<br />- network connection fails, server hangs, database unavailable<br />   → think of every possible problem<br />- mishandled exception can allow execution of code<br />   → the bad guys love this<br />- avoid default messages<br />   → you'll give away the underlying architecture<br /><br />Input validation<br />- what is the expected input?<br />   → validate actual vs expected<br />- document all input methods<br />   → forms, fields, types<br />- check and correct all input (normalization)<br />   → a zip code should be only x characters long with a letter in the X column<br />   → fix any data with improper input<br />- the fuzzers will find what you missed<br />   → don't give them an opening<br /><br />Stored procedures<br />- SQL databases<br />   → client sends detailed requests for data<br />   → ‘SELECT * FROM wp_options WHERE option_id=1’<br />- client requests can be complex<br />   → and sometimes modified by the user<br />   → this not be good<br />- stored procedures limit the client interactions<br />   → ‘CALL get_options’<br />   → that's it, no modifications to the query are possible<br />- to be really secure, use only stored procedures<br />   → the applications doesn't use any SQL queries<br /><br />Code signing<br />- an application is deployed<br />   → users run application executable or scripts<br />- so many security questions<br />   → has the application been modified in any way?<br />   → can you confirm that the application was written by a specific developer?<br />- the application code can be digitally signed by the developer<br />   → asymmetric encryption<br />   → a trusted CA signs the developer's public key<br />   → developer signs the code with their private key<br />   → for internal apps, use your own CA<br /><br />Encryption<br />- if you can see the source code, you look for security holes<br />   → source code is closely guarded<br />   → development platforms should use encryption<br />- if you're sending data over the network, it should be encrypted<br />   → easy to grab data from the air<br />- data at rest should be secure<br />   → encrypt important data<br />   → some OSs do this anyway<br /><br />Obfuscation/camouflage<br />- obfuscate<br />   → make something normally understandable very difficult to understand<br />- take perfectly readable code and turn it into nonsense<br />   → the developer keeps the readable code and gives you the chicken scratches<br />   → both sets of code perform exactly the same way<br />- helps prevent the search for security holes<br />   → makes it more difficult to figure out what's happening<br />   → but not impossible<br /><br />Code reuse/dead code<br />- code reuse<br />   → use old code to build new applications<br />   → copy and paste<br />- if the old code has security vulnerabilities, reusing the code spreads it to other applications<br />   → you're making this much more difficult for everyone<br />- dead code<br />   → calculations are made, code is executed, results are tallied<br />   → the results aren't used anywhere else in the application<br />- all code is an opportunity for an opportunity for a security problem<br />   → make sure code is as alive as possible<br /><br />Validation points<br />- server-side validation<br />   → all checks occur on the server<br />   → helps protect against malicious users<br />      ⇒ bad guys may not even be using your interface<br />- client-side validation<br />   → the end-users' app makes the validation decisions<br />   → can filter legitimate input from genuine users<br />   → may provide additional speed to the user<br />- use both<br />   → but especially server-side validation<br /><br />Memory management<br />- as a developer, you must be mindful of how memory is used<br />   → many opportunities to build vulnerable code<br />- never trust data input<br />   → malicious users can attempt to circumvent your code<br />- buffer overflows are a huge security risk<br />   → make sure your data matches your buffer size<br />- some built-in functions are insecure<br />   → use best practices when designing your code<br /><br />Third-party libraries and SDK's<br />- your programming language does everything<br />   → almost<br />- third-party libraries and software development kits<br />   → extend the functionality of a programming language<br />- security risk<br />   → application code written by someone else<br />   → might be secure. might not be<br />   → extensive testing is required<br />- balancing act<br />   → application features vs unknown code base<br /><br />Data exposure<br />- so much sensitive data<br />   → CC numbers, Social Security numbers, medical information, address details, email information<br />- how is the application handling the data?<br />   → no encryption when stored<br />   → no encryption across the network<br />   → displaying information on the screen<br />- all input and output processes are important<br />   → check them all for data exposure<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br
