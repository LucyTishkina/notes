<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Mobile Device Management</h1><br/>Mobile Device Management (MDM)<br />- manage company-owned and user-owned mobile devices<br />   → BYOD - bring your own device<br />- centralized management of the mobile devices<br />   → specialized functionality<br />- set policies on apps, data, camera, etc.<br />   → control the remote device<br />   → the entire device or a “partition”<br />- manage access control<br />   → force screen locks and PINs on these single user devices<br /><br />Application management<br />- managing mobile apps are a challenge<br />   → mobile devices install apps constantly<br />- not all applications are secure<br />   → and some are malicious<br />   → Android malware is a rapidly growing security concern<br />- manage application use through whitelist<br />   → only approved applications can be installed<br />   → managed through the MDM<br />- a management challenge<br />   → new applications must be checked and added<br /><br />Content management<br />- Mobile Content Management (MCM)<br />   → secure access to data<br />   → protect data from outsiders<br />- file sharing and viewing<br />   → on-site content (Microsoft Sharepoint, file servers)<br />   → Cloud-based storage (Box, Office 365)<br />- Data sent from the mobile device<br />   → DLP (Data Loss Prevention) prevents copy/paste of sensitive data<br />   → ensure data is encrypted on the mobile device<br />- managed from the mobile device manager (MDM)<br /><br />Remote wipe<br />- remove all data from your mobile device<br />   → even if you have no idea where it is<br />   → often managed from the MDM<br />- connect and wipe from the web<br />   → nuke it from anywhere<br />- need to plan for this<br />   → configure your mobile device now<br />- always have a backup<br />   → your data can be removed at any time<br />   → as you are walking out the door<br /><br />Geolocation<br />- precise tracking details<br />   → tracks within feet<br />- can be used for good (or bad)<br />   → find your phone<br />   → find you<br />- most phones provide an option to disable<br />   → limits functionality of the phones<br />- may be managed by the MDM<br /><br />Geofencing<br />- some MDM (mobile device managers) allow for geofencing<br />   → restrict or allow features when the device is in a particular area<br />- cameras<br />   → the camera might only work when outside the office<br />- authentication<br />   → only allow logins when the device is located in a particular area<br /><br />Screen lock<br />- all mobile devices can be locked<br />   → keep people out of your data<br />- simple passcode or strong passcode<br />   → numbers vs alphanumeric<br />- fail too many times?<br />   → erase the phone<br />- define a lockout policy<br />   → create aggressive lockout timers<br />   → completely lock the phone<br /><br />Push notification services<br />- information appears on the mobile device screen<br />   → the notification is “pushed” to your device<br />- no user intervention<br />   → receive notifications from one app when using a completely different app<br />- control of displayed notifications can be managed from the MDM<br />   → or notifications can be pushed from the MDM<br /><br />Passwords and PINs<br />- the universal help desk call<br />   → i need to reset my password<br />- mobile devices use multiple authentication methods<br />   → password/passphrase, PINs, patterns<br />- recovery process can be initiated from the MDM<br />   → password reset option is provided on the mobile device<br />   → “What is the name of your favourite car maiden cat's color?"<br />- MDM also has full control<br />   → complete remove all security controls<br />   → not the default or best practice<br /><br />Biometrics<br />- you are the authentication factor<br />   → fingerprint, face<br />- may not be the most secure authentication factor<br />   → useful in some environments<br />   → completely forbidden in others<br />- availability is managed through the MDM<br />   → organization determines the security of the device<br />- can be managed per-app<br />   → some apps require additional biometric authentication<br /><br />Context-aware authentication<br />- who needs 2FA?<br />   → the bad guys can get around anything<br />- authentication can be contextual<br />- combine multiple contexts<br />   → where you normally login (IP address)<br />   → geolocation (GPS information)<br />   → other devices that may be paired (Bluetooth, etc)<br />   → and others<br />- an emerging technology<br />   → another way to keep data safe<br /><br />Containerization<br />- difficult to separate personal from business<br />   → especially when the device is BYOD<br />   → owned by the employee<br />- separate enterprise mobile apps and data<br />   → create a virtual “container” for company data<br />   → a contained area - limit data sharing<br />   → storage segmentation keeps data separate<br />- easy to manage offboarding<br />   → only the company information is deleted<br />   → personal data is retained<br />   → keep your pictures, video, music, email, etc.<br /><br />Full device encryption<br />- scramble all of the data on the mobile device<br />   → even if you lose it, the contents are safe<br />- devices handle this in different ways<br />   → strongest/stronger/strong?<br />- encryption isn't trivial<br />   → uses a lot of CPU cycles<br />   → complex integration between hardware and software<br />- don't lose or forget your password<br />   → there's no recovery<br />   → often back up on the MDM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
