<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Vulnerability Types</h1><br/>Vulnerability Types<br />- there are many types of vulnerabilities<br />   → some digital, some physical<br />- cover a broad scope<br />   → programming, network design, process/procedure<br />- any of these can be exploited at any time<br />   → or multiples at the same time<br />   → be on your toes<br /><br />Race condition<br />- a programming conundrum<br />   → sometimes, things happen at the same time<br />   → this can be bad if you've not planned for it<br />- two bank accounts with $100<br />   → user 1 and user 2 transfer $50 from Account A to Account B<br />   → Expected outcome: Account A has $50, Account B has $150 (or A has $0 and B has $200)<br />- What if you don't perform proper validation?<br />   → user 1 and user 2 check the account balances ($100 in each account)<br />   → user 1 transfers $50 from Account A (now at $50) to Account B (now at $150)<br />   → at about the same time, user 2 transfers $50 from Account A (still has $100, right? so now at $50) to Account B (now at $200)<br />- Outcome: Account A has $50, Account B has $200<br /><br />Race conditions can cause big problems<br />- January 2004 - Mars rover “Spirit”<br />   → reboot when a problem is identified<br />   → problem is with the file system<br />   → reboot because of the file system problem<br />- GE Energy - Energy Management System<br />   → when three power lines failed at the same time, no alert was sent<br />   → caused the Northeast Blackout of 2003<br />- Therac-25 radiation therapy machine in the 1980s<br />   → used software interlocks instead of hardware<br />   → race condition caused 100 times the normal dose of radiation<br />   → six patients injured, three deaths<br /><br />End-of-life vulnerabilities<br />- end-of-life<br />   → without vendor support, no security patches<br />- March 2017 - Microsoft patches Windows to protect against SMB vulnerability<br />   → Windows XP, Windows 8, and Server 2003 were end-of-life and not included<br />- May 2017 - WannaCrypt ransomware infects hundreds of thousands of computers<br />   → end-of-life systems were wide open<br />- upgrade to maintain security<br />   → no other choice<br /><br />Embedded system vulnerabilities<br />- no direct access to the operating system<br />   → you'll probably never see it<br />- these devices are usually connected to the Internet<br />   → very convenient to the hacker<br />- old, outdated OS software<br />   → Why upgrade? May not even be upgradeable<br />- June 2017 - Wikileaks releases CIA files called Vault7<br />   → CIA takes advantage of vulnerabilities on Linksys and D-Link routers<br />   → they can easily get your administrative password<br />   → at which point they install their own firmware<br /><br />Lack of vendor support<br />- security requires diligence<br />   → the potential for a vulnerability is always there<br />- vendors are the only ones who can fix their products<br />   → assuming they know about the problem<br />   → and care about fixing it<br />- Trane Comfortlink II thermostats<br />   → control the temperature from your phone<br />   → Trane notified of three vulnerabilities in April 2014<br />   → Two patched in April 2015, one in January 2016<br /><br />Improper input handling<br />- many applications accept user input<br />   → we put data in, we get data back<br />- all input should be considered malicious<br />   → check everything, trust nobody<br />- allowing invalid input can be devastating<br />   → SQL injections, buffer overflows, denial of service, etc.<br />- It takes a lot of work to find input that can be used maliciously<br />   → but they will find it<br /><br />Improper error handling<br />- Errors happen<br />   → and you should probably know about it<br />- Messages should be just informational enough<br />   → avoid too much detail<br />   → network information<br />   → memory dump<br />   → stack traces<br />   → database dumps<br />- this is an easy one to find and fix<br />   → a development best-practice<br /><br />Misconfiguration/weak configuration<br />- very easy to leave a door open<br />   → the hackers will always find it<br />- September 2015 - Patreon is compromised<br />   → used a debugger to help monitor and troubleshoot web site issues<br />   → was left exposed to the Internet<br />   → effectively allowed for remote code executions<br />   → gigabytes of customer data was released online<br />- June 2017 - 14 million Verizon records exposed<br />   → third-party left an Amazon S3 data repository open<br />   → researcher found the data before the bad guys<br /><br />Default configuration<br />- every application and network device has a default login<br />   → not all of these are ever changed<br />- Mirai botnet<br />   → takes advantage of default configurations<br />   → takes over Internet of Things (IoT) devices<br />   → 60+ default configurations<br />   → cameras, routers, doorbells, garage door openers, etc.<br />- Mirai released as open-source software<br />   → there's a lot more where that came from<br /><br />Untrained users<br />- it takes one person to allow a breach<br />   → and it can happen without the user even knowing<br />- training is critical<br />   → emails don't work<br />   → this is time consuming and expensive<br />   → and important<br />- annual reinforcement<br />   → quiz and role play<br />   → become familiar with common situations<br /><br />Improperly configured accounts<br />- techical issue and process issue<br />   → frequent audits are important<br />- accounts without a need<br />   → abandoned and unnecessary accounts<br />- accounts with administrative access<br />   → these should be very limited<br />- should not be able to login directly as administrator<br />   → unless it's on a server console<br /><br />Vulnerable business processes<br />- if there's a way to game the system, the bad guys will find it<br />   → it doesn't have to be a technical vulnerability<br />- the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)<br />   → electronically send payment instructions between banks<br />- February 2016 - Bangladesh Bank<br />   → Dridex malware used to steal SWIFT credentials<br />   → Attempted to steal $951 million whil the bank was closed<br />   → hackers misspelled “Foundation” as “Fundation”<br />   → $81 millions was lost<br /><br />Weak cipher suites<br />- the suite<br />   → Encryption protocol (AES, 3DES, etc.)<br />   → length of the encryption key (40 bits, 128 bits, 256 bits, etc.)<br />   → hash used for the integrity check (SHA, MD5, etc.)<br />- some cipher suites are easier to break than others<br />   → stay updated with the latest best practices<br />- TLS is one of the most common issues<br />   → over 300 cipher suites<br />- Which are good and which are bad?<br />   → weak or null encryption (less than 128 bit key sizes), outdated hashed (MD5)<br /><br />Memory/buffer vulnerabilities<br />- manipulating memory can be advantageous<br />   → relatively difficult to accomplish<br />- memory leak<br />   → unused memory is not properly released<br />   → begins to slowly grow in size<br />   → eventually uses all available memory<br />   → system crashes<br />- integer overflow<br />   → large number into a smaller sized space<br />   → where does the extra number go?<br />   → you shouldn't be able to manipulate memory this way<br />- Buffer overflow<br />   → overwriting a buffer of memory<br />   → spills over into other memory areas<br />- NULL pointer dereference<br />   → programming technique that references a portion of memory<br />   → what happens if that reference points to nothing?<br />   → application crash, debug information displayed, DoS<br />- DLL injection<br />   → the bad guys didn't write the application<br />   → but they could write an external library and manipulate the operating system or application to run the library<br /><br />System sprawl/undocumented assets<br />- hundreds of projects, test platforms, active operating system, production VMs<br />   → spin up a new instance with a click<br />   → keeping track is a challenge<br />- easy to miss a forgotten computer<br />   → under a desk<br />   → part of a retired application<br />- not part of regular security patches<br />   → these become pivot points<br /><br />Architecture/design weaknesses<br />- the best security system fails if you don't have locks on the doors<br />   → the network doors aren't always visible<br />- examine every part of the network<br />   → ingress<br />   → VPN<br />   → third-party access<br />   → internal controls<br />   → account access<br />   → front door access<br />   → conference room access<br /><br />New threats/zero day<br />- what you don't know can really hurt you<br />   → and you won't even see it coming<br />- vulnerabilities are sitting in your system, waiting for someone to find them<br />   → some problems are hidden for years<br />- as soon as the problem is discovered (day zero), patch it<br />   → there isn't always time to properly test<br />   → balance severity with stability<br />- WannaCry ransomware hit on May 12, 2017<br />   → however, the patch had been available since March 14<br /><br />Improper certificate and key management<br />- manage your keys and certificates<br />   → this needs to be well planned<br />   → important decisions, can't do this on the fly<br />- what will be the organizations certificate authority?<br />- how will the CA content be protected?<br />- how will intermediate CAs be created and managed?<br />- who will validate and sign the organization's certificates?<br />- what is the validation process?<br />- etc.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
