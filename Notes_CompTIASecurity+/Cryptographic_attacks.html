<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Cryptographic attacks</h1><br/>Cryptographic attacks<br />- you've encrypted data and sent it to another person<br />   → is ir really secure?<br />   → how do you know?<br />- the bad guy doesn't have the combination (the key)<br />   → so they break the safe (the cryptography)<br />- finding ways to undo the security<br />   → there are many potential cryptographic shortcomings<br />   → the problem is often the implementation<br /><br />Known plaintext attack (KPA)<br />- attacker has the encrypted data and some of the plaintext<br />   → if you know some original plaintext, you may be able to find a “wedge” that is revealed in the ciphertext<br />   → the known plaintext is the “crib”<br />- WWII Enigma cipher<br />   → easier to break if you knew some plaintext<br />   → daily weather report (wetter)<br />   → numbers were common (eins)<br />   → Royal Air Force would ‘seed’ the North Sea with mines<br />      ⇒ Future messages would reference the harbor name<br /><br />The password file<br />- different across operating systems<br />   → different hash methods<br /><br />Rainbow tables<br />- an optimized, pre-built set of hashes<br />   → doesn't need to contain every hash<br />   → the calculations have already been done<br />- remarkable speed increase<br />   → especially with longer password lengths<br />- need different tables for different hashing methods<br />   → Windows is different than MySQL<br />- rainbow tables won't work with salted hashes<br />   → additional random value added to the original hash<br /><br />Dictionary attacks<br />- people use common words as passwords<br />   → you can find them in the dictionary<br />- if you're using brute force, you should start with the easy ones<br />   → password, ninja, football<br />- many common wordlists available on the 'net<br />   → some are customized by language or line of work<br />- this will catch the low-hanging fruit<br />   → you'll need some smarter attacks for the smarter people<br /><br />Brute force<br />- the password is the key<br />   → secret phrase<br />   → stored hash<br />- brute force attacks - Online<br />   → keep trying the login process<br />   → very slow<br />   → most accounts will lockout after a number of failed attempts<br />- brute force the hash - offline<br />   → obtain the list of users and hashes<br />   → calculate a password hash, compare it to a stored hash<br />   → large computational resource requirements<br /><br />Birthday attack<br />- in a classroom of 23 students, what is the chance of 2 students sharing a birthday?<br />   → about 50%<br />   → for a class of 30, the chance is about 70%<br />- in the digitabl world, this is a hash collision<br />   → a hash collision is the same hash value for two different plaintexts<br />   → find a collision through brute force<br />- the attacker will generate multiple versions of plaintext to match the hashes<br />   → protect yourself with a large hash output size<br /><br />Collisions<br />- hash digests are supposed to be unique<br />   → different input data should never create the same hash<br />- MD5 hash<br />   → Message Digest Algorithm 5<br />   → First published in April 1992<br />   → Collisions identified in 1996<br />- December 2008: Researchers created CA certificate that appeared legitimate when MD5 is checked<br />   → built other certificates that appeared to be legit and issued by RapidSSL<br /><br />Downgrade attack<br />- instead of using perfectly good encryption, use something that's not so great<br />   → force the systems to downgrade the security<br />- 1995 - SSL/TLS vulnerability - FREAK - Factoring RSA Export Keys<br />   → public key pairs can be limited to 512 bits or less<br />      ⇒ 1990 U.S. cryptography export regulations<br />   → weak keys could be forced during the SSL handshake<br />   → modern systems can easily brute force the small keys<br />   → vulnerability was patched<br /><br />Weak implementations<br />- weak encryption<br />   → one weak link breaks the entire chain<br />- 802.11 WEP<br />   → the RC4 key can be recovered by gathering enough packets<br />   → the algorithm didn't sufficiently protect the key<br />- DES - Data Encryption Standard<br />   → relatively small 56-bit keys<br />   → modern systems can brute force this pretty quickly<br /><br />Replay attacks<br />- some cryptographic algorithms are more susceptible than others to a replay attack<br />   → a hash with no salt, no session ID tracking, no encryption<br />- replay countermeasure may be part of the cryptography<br />   → Kerberos and Kerberos derivatives include time stamps<br />   → Anything after the time to live (TTL) is discarded<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
