<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Version Control and Change</h1><br/>The constant of change<br />- there will always be modifications, bug fixes, new features, and security patches<br />   → the important part is how you manage change<br />   → it's only chaotic if allow it to be<br />- changes during application development<br />   → requires version control<br />- changes to production<br />   → formal change management<br /><br />Version Control<br />- create a file, make a change, make another change, and another change<br />   → track those changes, revert back to a previous version<br />- commonly used in software development<br />   → but also in OS, wiki software, and cloud-based file storage<br />- useful for security<br />   → compare versions over time<br />   → identify modifications to important files<br />- a security challenge<br />   → historical information can be a security risk<br /><br />Change management<br />- change control<br />   → a formal process for managing change<br />   → avoid downtime, confusion and mistakes<br />- nothing changes without the process<br />   → place for a change<br />   → estimate the risk associated with the change<br />   → have a recovery plan if the change doesn't work<br />   → test before making the change<br />   → document all of this and get approval<br />   → make the change<br /><br />Change management and security<br />- every change has a security component<br />   →  each change must be evaluated separately<br />- install security patches<br />   → ideally makes the systems more secure<br />- application update<br />   → new version, new code, new security concerns<br />- change to the application instance<br />   → new servers, updated middleware, etc.<br />   → everything must be evaluated together</div></body></html>
