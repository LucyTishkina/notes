<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Operating System Security</h1><br/>Operating System types<br />- there's a little overlap in most OS's<br />- network<br />   → supports servers, workstations, and other network-connected devices<br />- server<br />   → designed to operate as a server<br />   → web server, database server<br />- workstation<br />   → optimized for user applications<br />      ⇒ email, browsing, office apps, video editing<br />- appliances<br />   → purpose-built<br />   → usually a minimal OS, often unseen by the user<br />- kiosk<br />   → public device<br />   → OS is tightly locked down<br />- mobile OS<br />   → designed for touch screen phones and tablets<br />   → optimized for mobile hardware<br /><br />Patch managements<br />- incredibly important<br />   → system stability<br />   → security fixes<br />- service packs<br />   → all at once<br />- monthly updates<br />   → incremental (and important)<br />- emergency out-of-band updates<br />   → zero-day and important security discoveries<br /><br />Update options<br />- Windows update<br />   → bring Windows up-to-date on each workstation<br />- Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)<br />   → centralized management for Windows devices<br />- Mac OS - Software Update, App Store<br />   → available on the Apple menu<br />- Linux<br />   → many different options<br />   → yum, apt-get, rpm, graphical front-ends<br /><br />The Patching Process<br />- not always seamless<br />   → may take some planning<br />- may introduce other problems<br />   → the fix can cause another problem<br />- pick and choose<br />   → you don't have to install every single patch<br />- often centrally managed<br />   → the update server determines when you patch<br />   → test all of your apps, then deploy<br />   → efficiently manage bandwidth<br /><br />Disabling unnecessary services<br />- every service has the potential for trouble<br />   → the worst vulnerabilities are 0-day<br />- “unnecessary” isn't always obvious<br />   → Windows 7 over 130 services by default, Windows 10 has over 240<br />- this may require a lot of research<br />   → many different sources<br />   → don't rely on the manufacturer<br />- trial and error may be necessary<br />   → testing and monitoring<br /><br />Least functionality<br />- limit the OS to only what's needed<br />   → every function has a potential security risk<br />- may be different depending on the use<br />   → shipping/ receiving vs IT development vs a kiosk<br />- extensive configurations<br />   → disable printer installation<br />   → disable changing system time<br />   → disable taking ownership of file system objects<br />   → deny log on as a service<br /><br />Secure configurations<br />- fine tuning of the OS<br />   → make your least functionality very secure<br />- many of these will apply regardless of the system use<br />   → the OS is common to all<br />- example secure configuration policies<br />   → stay updated with the latest patches<br />   → compromised systems are re-imaged (not “cleaned”)<br />   → changes to the standard build must go through change management<br />   → perform regular integrity checks of OS files<br /><br />Evaluation Assurance Level<br />- Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation<br />   → also called Common Criteria (or CC)<br />   → an international computer security certification system (ISO/IEC 15408)<br />   → a common reference for US Federal Government<br />- Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL)<br />   → EAL1 through EAL7<br />- trusted OS<br />   → the OS is EAL compliant<br />      ⇒ EAL4 is the most accepted minimum level<br /><br />Application whitelisting/blacklisting<br />- any application can be dangerous<br />   → vulnerabilities, trojan horses, malware<br />- security policy can control app execution<br />   → whitelisting and blacklisting<br />- whitelisting<br />   → nothing runs unless it's approved<br />   → very restrictive<br />- blacklisting<br />   → nothing on the “bad list" can be executed<br />   → anti-virus, anti-malware<br /><br />Examples of application whitelisting<br />- decisions are made in the OS<br />   → often built-in to the OS management<br />- application hash<br />   → only allows applications with this unique identifier<br />- certificate<br />   → allow digitally signed apps from certain publishers<br />- path<br />   → only run applications in these folders<br />- network zone<br />   → the apps can only run from this network zone<br /><br />Disabling unnecessary accounts<br />- all OS include other accounts<br />   → guest, root, mail, etc.<br />- not all accounts are necessary<br />   → disable/remove the unnecessary<br />- disable interactive logins<br />   → not all accounts need to login<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
