<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Continuity of Operations</h1><br/>Tabletop exercises<br />- performing a full-scale disaster drill can be costly<br />   → and time consuming<br />- many of the logistics can be determined through analysis<br />   → you don't physically have to go through a disaster or drill<br />- get key players together for a tabletop exercise<br />   → talk through a simulated disaster<br /><br />The scope of a tabletop exercise<br />- decide on complexity<br />   → invite local first responders or just discuss internally?<br />- determine the scope of the disaster<br />   → water main break? death and injuries?<br />- involve everyone<br />   → perhaps even make the discussion a surprise<br />- don't assume that every piece of information is going to be available in a disaster<br />   → the tabletop exercise should find the gaps<br /><br />After-action reports (AAR)<br />- exercise scope and objectives<br />   → what's the endgame?<br />- methodology<br />   → detailed explanation of the exercise<br />- what worked? what didn't work?<br />   → the good and the bad<br />- next steps<br />   → update procedures, add a new set of tools<br />   → prepare for the next exercise<br /><br />Failover<br />- recovery site is prepped<br />   → data is synchronized<br />- a disaster is called<br />   → business processes failover to the alternate processing site<br />- problem is addressed<br />   → this can take hours, weeks, or longer<br />- revert back to the primary location<br />   → the process must be documented for both directions<br /><br />Alternate business practices<br />- not everything goes according to plan<br />   → disasters can cause a disruption to the norm<br />- we rely on our computer systems<br />   → technology is pervasive<br />- there needs to be an alternative<br />   → manual transactions<br />   → paper receipts<br />   → phone calls for transaction approvals<br />- these must be documented and tested before a problem occurs<br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
