<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Common Security Issues</h1><br/>Unencrypted credentials<br />- authentication is a critical process<br />   → all data must be protected<br />- some protocols aren't encrypted<br />   → all traffic sent in the clear<br />   → Telnet, FTP, SMTP, IMAP<br />- verify with a packet capture<br />   → view everything sent over the network<br /><br />Logs and event anomalies<br />- gather as much information as possible<br />   → will be important later<br />- many different sources<br />   → switches, routers, firewalls, servers, IPS<br />- use a security information and event management (SIEM) system<br />   → consolidate logs and correlate data<br />   → extensive reporting<br /><br />Permission issues<br />- a simple oversight<br />   → a huge vulnerability<br />   → the door was left open - no lockpicking required<br />- June 2017 - 14 million Verizon records exposed<br />   → third-party left an Amazon S3 data repository open<br />   → researcher found the data before the bad guys<br />- confirm permissions on initial configuration<br />   → provide a process for changes and updates<br />   → perform periodic audits<br /><br />Access violations<br />- segmentation fault<br />- your OS is looking out for you<br />   → prevents access to a restricted area of memory<br />- might be a programming error<br />   → a pointer to the wrong location<br />- could be a security issue<br />   → malware attempting to access restricted memory<br />   → denial of service<br /><br />Certificate issue<br />- trust<br />   → a certificate should be signed by someone you trust<br />   → it's really someone your computer trusts<br />- certificates should also be relatively new<br />   → you don't want certificates to get too old<br />- application must perform the proper certificate checks<br />- February 2017 - researcher finds 76 iOS apps that are missing TLS certificate checks<br />   → 18 milliion downloads<br />   → easy to MitM attack<br /><br />Data exfiltration<br />- data is your most valuable asset<br />   → it might also be valuable to other people<br />- you've built a high-speed network<br />   → also easy to remove through DVD-ROMs or USB flash drives<br />- July 2017 - Time Warner / Home Box Office<br />   → 1.5 terabytes of data exfiltrated<br />   → “HBO recently experienced a cyber incident, which resulted in the compromise of proprietary information”<br /><br />Misconfigured devices<br />- another example of leaving the door open<br />   → the bad guys walk right in<br />- default username and password<br />   → easy to authenticate<br />- outdated software<br />   → known vulnerabilities<br />- running maintenance code<br />   → debug information displayed to users<br />- firewalls<br />   → rules provide too much access<br />   → can be difficult to audit with a large rule base<br />- content filters<br />   → URLs are not specific enough<br />   → some protocols not filtered (i.e. https)<br />- access points<br />   → no encryption mechanisms<br />   → open configurations from the wireless side<br /><br />Weak security configurations<br />- digital security works great<br />   → until it doesn't work great any longer<br />- too old - DES (Data Encryption Standard) encryption<br />   → created in 1975, 56 bit keys<br />   → small key size is easily brute-forced with today's technologies<br />- Encryption vulnerabilities - WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)<br />   → Initial 802.11 encryption algorithm<br />   → vulnerabilities found with RC4 ciphers and initialization vectors<br />- hash collisions - SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)<br />   → many collision attacks identified - different documents with the same hash<br />   → no longer viable<br /><br />Personal issues<br />- the weakest link<br />   → people make mistakes<br />- policy violations<br />   → it's in your acceptable use policy (AUP) documents<br />- insider threats<br />   → authenticated users have more free reign than non-authenticated<br />   → important to assign the correct rights and permissions<br />- social engineering<br />   → we're always so willing to help someone in need<br />   → they'll steal everything over the phone<br />- social media<br />   → posting of internal information<br />   → public companies must not disclose meaningful information<br />   → most organizations have a policy and marketing team<br />- personal emails<br />   → emails sent from work imply endorsement by the organization<br />   → uses company resources<br />   → shouldn't you be working on those TPS reports?<br /><br />Unauthorized software<br />- you don't know where that's been<br />   → malware, spyware, ransomware<br />- conflicts<br />   → may conflict with the organization's mission-critical software<br />- licensing<br />   → you're going to pay for that, right?<br />- ongoing support<br />   → who's going to upgrade the unauthorized software? security patches?<br />   → what happens when it stops working?<br /><br />Baseline deviation<br />- everything should be well documented<br />   → hardware, software, network traffic patterns, data storage<br />- any changes to the norm should be identified<br />   → and alerts should be sent immediately<br />- common with VPNs<br />   → security posture analysis before connecting to the network<br />   → if something deviates from the baseline, you must fix it<br />      ⇒ anti-virus version<br />      ⇒ signature version<br />      ⇒ operating system patches<br />   → no remote access until everything matches the baseline<br /><br />License compliance violation<br />- so many software licenses<br />   → operating systems, applications, hardware appliances<br />   → and they all license with different methodologies<br />- availability<br />   → everything works great when the license is valid<br />   → meeting the expiration date may cause problems<br />      ⇒ application may stop working completely<br />- integrity<br />   → data and applications must be accurate and complete<br />   → a missing/bad license may cause problems with data integrity<br /><br />Asset management<br />- identify and track computing assets<br />   → usually an automated process<br />- respond faster to security problem<br />   → you know who, what, and where<br />- keep an eye on the most valuable assets<br />   → both hardware and data<br />- track licenses<br />   → you know exactly how many you'll need<br />- verify that all devices are up to date<br />   → security patches, anti-malware signature updates, etc.<br /><br />Authentication issues<br />- determine if someone is really who they say they are<br />   → papers ,please<br />- number of factors<br />   → the more, the better<br />   → the more, the more chances of problems<br />- a lapse in any part of the authentication process can open the entire network<br />   → weak passwords, not enough authentication factors, etc.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
