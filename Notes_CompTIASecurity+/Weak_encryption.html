<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Weak encryption</h1><br/>The strength of encryption<br />- strong cryptography vs weak cryptography<br />   → it's all relative<br />- practically everything can be brute forced<br />   → try every possible key<br />- strong algorithms have been around for a while<br />   → that's part of the reason that they are strong<br />   → Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) had design flaws<br />- Strong algorithms<br />   → PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)<br />- Weak algorithms<br />   → WEP (design flaw), DES (Data Encryption Standard - 56-bit keys)<br /><br />Give weak keys a workout<br />- a weak key is a weak key<br />   → by itself, it's not very secure<br />- make a weak key stronger by performing multiple processes<br />   → hash a password, hash the hash of the password, ...<br />   → key stretching, key strengthening<br />- brute force attacks would require reversing each of those hashes<br />   → the attacker has to spend much more time, even though the key is small<br /><br /></div></body></html>
