<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Analyzing Security Output</h1><br/>Host-based IDS/IPS<br />- Intrusion Detection System/ Intrusion Prevention System<br />- started as a separate application<br />   → now integrated into many “endpoint” products<br />- protect based on signatures<br />   → decrypted data<br />- protect based on activity<br />   → why are you modifying that file?<br /><br />Antivirus<br />- the viruses are out there<br />   → it's just a matter of time<br />- from computers running Kaspersky Lab products in Q1 2017:<br />   → 470+ million malicious attacks blocked<br />   → ~80 millioin malicious URLs identified<br />   → ~240 000 blocked ransomware attacks<br />   → 1+ million malicious installation packages on mobile devices<br />- antivirus applications will alert and log on malicious software<br />   → download or execute<br />   → visit known bad URL<br /><br />Filte integrity check<br />- Operating system check<br />   → are the original files still in place?<br />   → sfc - Windows<br />   → output : cbs.log - component based servicing<br /><br />Host-based firewalls<br />- protect against others on the network<br />   → restrict access to your personal computer<br />- protect wherever you go<br />   → required for laptops and mobile devices<br />- restricts by application and network port numbers<br />   → the firewall knows what you're doing<br />- log displays connection attempts<br />   → allowed and denied access<br /><br />Application whitelisting<br />- decisions are made in the operating system<br />   → often built-in to the operating system management<br />- application hash<br />   → only allows applications with this unique identifier<br />- certificate<br />   → allow digitally signed apps from certain publishers<br />- path<br />   → only run applications in these folders<br />- network zone<br />   → the apps can only run from this network zone<br />- logs are integrated into the OS<br /><br />Removable media control<br />- USB drives, portable hard drives<br />   → the bane of the security professional<br />- malware infections<br />   → drives brought from home<br />   → USB drives all over the parking lot<br />- Exfiltration<br />   → terabytes of data that fits into your pocket<br />- Windows Event Log<br />   → security auditing<br />   → view USB media use, log filenames copied to removable drives<br /><br /><br />Advanced malware tools<br />- specialized removal and recovery tools<br />   → malware techniques vary widely<br />- malware is pervasive<br />   → spreads to all part of your operating system<br />- the best recovery is to delete and restore from a good backup<br />   → you don't always have this option<br />- research as much as possible<br />   → gather recon from the malware tools<br />   → stop it and prevent it<br /><br />Patch management tools<br />- security patch logs<br /><br />UTM / All-in-one security appliance<br />- Unified Threat Management (UTM) / Web security gateway<br />- URL filter / Content inspection<br />- malware inspection<br />- spam filter<br />- CSU/DSU<br />- router, switch<br />- firewall<br />- IDS/IPS<br />- bandwidth shaper<br />- VPN endpoint<br /><br />UTM logs<br />- many events logged - operating system, firewall, etc.<br /><br />Data Loss Prevention (DLP)<br />- where's your data?<br />   → Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, medical records<br />- stop the data before the bad guys get it<br />   → data “leakage”<br />- so many sources, so many destinations<br />   → often requires multiple solutions in different places<br /><br />Data Execution Prevention (DEP)<br />- No-eXecute bit<br />   → Intel calls it the XD bit (eXecute Disable)<br />   → AMD calls it Enhanced Virus Protection<br />- Designate sections of memory as executing code or data<br />   → code can't run from protected memory locations<br />   → prevents malware and viruses from executing<br />- the OS must support this feature<br />   → Windows calls it Data Execution Prevention (DEP)<br />   → enabled automatically as default<br />   → all logs are in the Event Viewer<br /><br />Web application firewall (WAF)<br />- not like a “normal” firewall<br />   → applies rules to HTTP/HTTPS conversations<br />- allow or deny based on expected input<br />   → unexpected input is a common method of exploiting an application<br />- SQL injection<br />   → add your own commands to an application's SQL query<br />- a major focus of Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
