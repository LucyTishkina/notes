<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Hashing Algorithms</h1><br/>MD5 Message Digest Algorithm<br />- Designed by Ronald Rivest<br />   → one of the “fathers” of modern cryptography<br />- first published: April 1992<br />   → replaced MD4<br />   → 128-bit hash value<br />- 1996: vulnerabilities found<br />   → not collision resistant<br />- December 2008: researchers created CA certificate that appeared legitimate when MD5 is checked<br />   → built other certificates that appeared to be legit and issued by RapidSSL<br /><br />Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)<br />- developed by the National Security Agency (NSA)<br />   → A US Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)<br />- SHA-1<br />   → widely used<br />   → 160-bit digest<br />   → 2005: collision attacks published<br />- SHA-2<br />   → the preferred SHA variant<br />   → up to 512-bit digests<br />   → SHA-1 is now retired for most US Government use<br /><br />HMAC<br />- Hash-based Message Authentication Code<br />   → combine a hash with a secret key<br />   → e.g., HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1<br />- verify data integrity and authenticity<br />   → no fancy asymmetric encryption required<br />- used in network encryption protocols<br />   → IPsec, TLS<br /><br />RIPEMD<br />- a family of message digest algorithms<br />   → RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest<br />- RACE<br />   → Research and Development in Advanced Communications Technologies in Europe<br />   → created to help with Integrated Broadband Communications in Europe<br />   → centralized cryptographic standards and management<br />- Original RIPEMD was found to have collision issues (2004)<br />   → effectively replaced with RIPEMD-160 (no known collision issues)<br />   → based upon MD4 design but performs similar to SHA-1<br />   → RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-256, RIPEMD-320<br /><br /></div></body></html>
