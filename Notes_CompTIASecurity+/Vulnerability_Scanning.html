<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Vulnerability Scanning</h1><br/>Vulnerability scanning<br />- usually minimally invasive<br />   → unlike penetration test<br />- port scan<br />   → poke around and see what's open<br />- identify systems<br />   → and security devices<br />- test from the outside and inside<br />   → don't dismiss insider threats<br />- gather as much information as possible<br />   → we'll separate wheat from chaff later<br /><br />Scan types<br />- scanners are very powerful<br />   → use many different techniques to identify vulnerabilities<br />- non-instrusive scans<br />   → gather information, don't try to exploit a vulnerability<br />- intrusive scans<br />   → you'll try out the vulnerability to see if it works<br />- non-credential scans<br />   → the scanner can't login to the remote device<br />- credentialed scan<br />   → you're a normal user, emulates an insider attack<br /><br />nikto - webserver scanner<br /><br />Identify vulnerability<br />- the scanner looks for everything<br />   → well, not _everything_<br />   → the signatures are the key<br />- The vulnerabilities can be cross-referenced online<br />   → almost all scanners give you place a to go<br />   → National Vulnerability Database<br />   → Microsoft Security Bulletins<br />- Some vulnerabilities cannot be definitively identified<br />   → you'll have to check manually to see if a system is vulnerable<br />   → but the scanner gives you a heads-up<br /><br />Vulnerability scan results<br />- lack of security controls<br />   → no firewall<br />   → no anti-virus<br />   → no anti-spyware<br />- misconfigurations<br />   → open shares<br />   → guest access<br />- real vulnerabilities<br />   → especially newer ones<br />   → occasionally the old ones<br /><br />Dealing with false positives<br />- false positives<br />   → a vulnerability is identified that doesn't really exist<br />- this is different than a low-severity vulnerability<br />   → it's real, but it many not be your highest priority<br />- false negatives<br />   → a vulnerability exists, but you didn't detect it<br />- update to the latest signatures<br />   → if you don't know about it, you can't see it<br />- work with the vulnerability detection manufacturer<br />   → they many need to update their signatures for your environment<br /><br /></div></body></html>
