<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">PKI Components</h1><br/>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)<br />- policies, procedures, hardware, software, people<br />   → digital certificates: create, distribute, manage, store, revoke<br />- this is a big, big thing<br />   → lots of planning<br />- also refers to the binding of public keys to people or devices<br />   → the certificate authority<br />   → it's all about trust<br /><br />The key management lifecycle<br />- key generation<br />   → create a key with the requested strength using the proper cipher<br />- certificate generation<br />   → allocate a key to a user<br />- distribution<br />   → make the key available to the user<br />- storage<br />   → securely store and protect against unauthorized use<br />- revocation<br />   → manage keys that have been compromised<br />- expiration<br />   → a certificate may only have a certain “shelf life”<br /><br />Digital certificates<br />- a public key certificate<br />   →  binds a public key with a digital signature<br />   → and other details about the key holder<br />- a digital signature adds trust<br />   → PKI uses Certificate Authority for additional trust<br />   → Web of Trust adds other users for additional trust<br />- Certificate creation can be built into the OS<br />   → Part of Windows Domain services<br />   → 3rd-party Linux options<br /><br />What's in a digital certificate?<br />Field                                     Usage<br />Version                 The X.509 version supported (V1, V2 or V3)<br /><br />Serial Number       A number uniquely identifying the certificate with the domain of its CA<br /><br />Signature             The algorithm used by the CA to sign the certificate<br />Algorithm<br /><br />Issuer                   The name of the CA, expressed as a Distinguished Name (DN)<br /><br />Valid From/            Date and time during which the certificate is valid<br />Valid To<br /><br />Subject                The name of the certificate holder, expressed as a Distinguished Name<br /><br />Public Key             Public key and algorithm used by the certificate holder<br /><br />Extensions           V3 certificates can be defined with extended attributes, such as friendly subject or issuer names, contact email addresses, and intended key usage<br /><br /><br />Certificate extensions<br />- add more information to a digital certificate<br />   → extend the functionality and use of the cert<br />- Standard extensions<br />   → digitalSignature (0) - used to digitally sign documents<br />   → nonRepudiation (1) - used by a non-repudiation service<br />   → keyEncipherment (2) - used for key exchange<br />   → dataEncipherment (3) - used to make data confidential<br />   → keyAgreement (4) - used for Diffie-Hellman key agreement<br />   → keyCertSign (5) - used by a CA for certificate signing<br />   → cRLSign (6) - used to sign a Certificate Revocation List<br />   → encipherOnly (7) - used with Diffie-Hellman key agreement<br />   → decipherOnly (8) - used with Diffie-Hellman key agreement<br /><br />Commercial certificate authorities<br />- built-in to your browser<br />   → any browser<br />- purchase your web site certificate <br />   → it will be trusted by everyone's browser<br />- create a key pair, send the public key to the CA to be signed<br />   → a certificate signing request (CSR)<br />- may provide different levels of trust and additional features<br />   → add a new “tag” to your web site<br /><br />Private certificate authorities<br />- you are your own CA<br />   →  build it in-house<br />   → your devices must trust the internal CA<br />- needed for medium-to-large organizations<br />   → many web servers and privacy requirements<br />- implement as part of your overall computing strategy<br />   → Windows Certificate Services, OpenCA<br /><br />PKI trust relationships<br />- Single CA<br />   → everyone receives their certificates from one authority<br />- Hierarchical<br />   → single CA issues certs to intermediate CAs<br />   → distributes the certificate management load<br />   → easier to deal with the revocation of an intermediate CA than the root CA<br /><br />Key revocation<br />- Certificate Revocation List (CRL)<br />   → maintained by the Certificate Authority (CA)<br />- many different reasons<br />   → changes all the time<br />- April 2014 - CVE-2014-0160<br />   → Heartbleed<br />   → OpenSSL flaw put the private key of affected web servers at risk<br />   → OpenSSL was patched, every web server certificate was replaced<br />   → Older certificates were moved to the CRL<br /><br />Getting revocation details to the browser<br />- OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)<br />   →  the browser can check certificate revocation<br />- messages usually sent to an OSCP responder via HTTP<br />   → easy to support over Internet links<br />- not all browsers/apps support OCSP<br />   → early Internet Explorer versions did not support OCSP<br />   → some support OCSP, but don't bother checking<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
