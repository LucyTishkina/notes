<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Mobile Device Enforcement</h1><br/>Third-party app stores<br />- centralized app clearinghouses<br />   → Apple App Store<br />   → Google Play<br />   → Microsoft Store<br />- Not all applications are secure<br />   → vulnerabilities, data leakage<br />- not all applications are appropriate for business use<br />   → games, instant messaging, etc.<br />- MDM can allow or deny app store use<br /><br />Rooting/jailbreaking<br />- mobile devices are purpose-built systems<br />   → you don't need access to the operating system<br />- gaining access<br />   → Android - rooting<br />   → Apple iOS - jailbreaking<br />- install custom firmware<br />   → replaces the existing operating system<br />- uncontrolled access<br />   → circumvent security features, sideload apps without using an app store<br />   → the MDM becomes relatively useless<br /><br />Carrier unlocking<br />- most phones are locked to a carrier<br />   → you can't use an AT&amp;T phone on Verizon<br />   → your contract with a carrier subsidizes the cost of the phone<br />- you can unlock the phone<br />   → if you carrier allows it<br />   → a carrier lock may be illegal in your country<br />- security revolves around connectivity<br />   → moving to another carrier can circumvent the MDM<br />   → preventing a  SIM unlock may not be possible on a personal device<br /><br />Firmware OTA updates<br />- the OS of a mobile device is constantly changing<br />   → similar to a desktop computer<br />- updates are provided over the air (OTA)<br />   → no cable required<br />- security patches or entire OS updates<br />   → significant changes without connecting the device<br />- this may not be a good thing<br />   → the MDM can manage what OTA updates are allowed<br /><br />Camera use<br />- cameras are controversial<br />   → they're not allowed a good thing<br />   → corporate espionage, inappropriate use<br />- almost impossible to control on the device<br />   → no good way to ensure the camera won't be used<br />- camera use can be controlled by the MDM<br />   → always disabled<br />   → enabled except for certain locations (geofencing)<br /><br />SMS/MMS<br />- Short Message Service / Multimedia Messaging Service<br />   → text messages, video, audio<br />- control of data can be a concern<br />   → outbound data leaks, financial disclosures<br />   → inbound notifications, phishing attempts<br />- MDM can enable or disable SMS/MMS<br />   → or only allow during certain timeframes or locations<br /><br />External media<br />- store data onto external or removable drives<br />   → SD flash memory or USB/lightning drives<br />- transfer data from flash<br />   → connect to a computer to retrieve<br />- this is very easy to do<br />   → limit data written to removable drives<br />   → or prevent the use of them from MDM<br /><br />USB OTG<br />- USB on-the-go<br />   → connect mobile devices directly together<br />   → no computer required, only a cable<br />- the mobile device can be both a host and a device<br />   → read from an external device, then act as a storage device itself<br />   → no need for a third-party storage device<br />- a USB 2.0 standard<br />   → commonly seen on Android devices<br />- extremely convenient<br />   → from a security perspective, it's too convenient<br /><br />Recording microphone<br />- audio recordings<br />   → there are microphones on every mobile device<br />- useful for meetings and note taking <br />   → a standard for college classes<br />- a legal liability<br />   → every state has different laws<br />   → every situation is different<br />- disable or geo-fence<br />   → manage from the MDM<br /><br />Geotagging/GPS tagging<br />- your phone knows where you are<br />   → location services, GPS<br />- adds your location to document metadata<br />   → longitude, latitude<br />   → photos, videos, etc.<br />- every document may contain geotagged information<br />   → you can track a user quite easily<br />- this may cause security concerns<br />   → take picture, upload to social media<br /><br />WiFi Direct / ad hoc<br />- we're so used to access points<br />   → SSID configurations<br />- the wireless standard includes an ad hoc mode<br />   → connect wireless devices directly<br />   → without an access point<br />- WiFi Direct simplifies the process<br />   → easily connect many devices together<br />   → common to see in home devices<br />- simplicity can aid vulnerabilities<br />   → invisible access to important devices<br /><br />Hotspot/tethering<br />- turn your phone into a WiFI hotspot<br />   → your own personal wireless router<br />   → extend the cellular data network to all of your devices<br />- dependent on phone type and provider<br />   → may require additional charges and data costs<br />- may provide inadvertent access to an internal network<br />   → ensure proper security / passcode<br /><br />Payment methods<br />- send small amounts of data wirelessly over a limited area (NFC)<br />   → built into your phone<br />   → payment systems, transportation, in-person information exchange<br />- a few different standards<br />   → Apple Pay, Android Pay, Samsung Pay<br />- Bypassing primary authentication would allow payment<br />   → use proper security<br />   → or disable completely<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br
