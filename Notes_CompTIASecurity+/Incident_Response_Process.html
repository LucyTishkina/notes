<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Incident Response Process</h1><br/>NIST SP800-61<br />- National Institute of Standards and Technology<br />   → NIST Special Publication 800-61<br />   → Computer Security Incident Handling Guide<br />- the incident response lifecycle<br />   → preparation<br />   → detection and analysis<br />   → containment, eradication, and recovery<br />   → post-incident activity<br /><br />Preparing for an incident<br />- communication methods<br />   → phones and contact information<br />- incident handling hardware and software<br />   → laptops, removable media, forensic software, digital cameras, etc.<br />- incident analysis resources<br />   → documentation, network diagrams, baselines, critical file hash values<br />- incident mitigation software<br />   → clean OS and application images<br />- policies needed for incident handling<br />   → everyone knows what to do<br /><br />The challenge of detection<br />- many different detection sources<br />   → different levels of detail, different levels of perception<br />- a large amount of “volume”<br />   → attacks are incoming all the time<br />   → how do you identify the legitimate threats?<br />- incidents are almost always complex<br />   → extensive knowledge needed<br /><br />Incident precursors<br />- an incident might occur in the future<br />   → this is your heads-up<br />- web server log<br />   → vulnerability scanner in use<br />- exploit announcement<br />   → Monthly Microsoft patch release, Adobe Flash update<br />- Direct threats<br />   → a hacking group doesn't like you<br /><br />Incident indicators<br />- an attack is underway<br />   → or an exploit is successful<br />- buffer overflow attempt<br />   → identified by an intrusion detection/prevention system<br />- anti-virus software identifies malware<br />   → deletes from OS and notifies administrator<br />- host-based monitor detects a configuration change<br />   → constantly monitors system files<br />- network traffic flows deviate from the norm<br />   → requires constant monitoring<br /><br />Isolation and containment<br />- generally a bad idea to let things run their course<br />   → an incident can spread quickly<br />   → it's your fault at that point<br />- sandboxes<br />   → the attacker thinks they're on a real system<br />   → but they're not<br />- isolation can be sometimes problematic<br />   → malware or infections can monitor connectivity<br />   → when connectivity is lost, everything could be deleted/encrypted/damaged<br /><br />Recovery after an incident<br />- get things back to normal<br />   → remove the bad, keep the good<br />- eradicate the bug<br />   → remove malware<br />   → disable breached user accounts<br />   → fix vulnerabilities<br />- recover the system<br />   → restore from backups<br />   → rebuild from scratch<br />   → replace compromised files<br />   → tighten down the perimeter<br /><br />Reconstitution<br />- a phased approach<br />   → it's difficult to fix everything at once<br />- recovery may take months<br />   → large-scale incidents require a large amount of work<br />- the plan should be efficient<br />   → start with quick, high-value security changes<br />      ⇒ patches, firewall policy changes<br />   → later phases involve much “heavier lifting”<br />      ⇒ infrastructure changes, large-scale security rollouts<br /><br />Lessons learned<br />- learn and improve<br />   → no system is perfect<br />- post-incident meeting<br />   → invite everyone affected by the incident<br />- don't wait too long<br />   → memories fade over time<br />   → some recommendations can be applied to the next event<br /><br />Answer the tough questions<br />- what happened exactly?<br />   → timestamp of the events<br />- how did your incident plans work?<br />   → did the process operate successfully?<br />- what would you do differently next time?<br />   → retrospective views provide context<br />- which indicators would you watch next time?<br />   → different precursors may give you better alerts<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
