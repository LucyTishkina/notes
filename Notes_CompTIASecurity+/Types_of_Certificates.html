<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Types of Certificates</h1><br/>Root certificate<br />- the public key certificate that identifies the root CA (Certificate Authority)<br />   → everything starts with this certificate<br />- the root certificate issues other certificates<br />   → intermediate CA certificates<br />   → any other certificates<br />- this is a very important certificate<br />   → take all security precautions<br />   → access to the root certificate allows for the creation of any trusted certificate<br /><br />Web server SSL certificates<br />- Domain validation certificate (DV)<br />   → owner of the certificate has some control over a DNS domain<br />- Extended validation certificate (EV)<br />   → additional checks have verified the certificate owner's identity<br />   → green name on the address bar<br />- Subject Alternative Name (SAN)<br />   → extension to an X.509 certificate<br />   → lists additional identification information<br />   → allows a certificate to support many different domains<br />- Wildcard domain<br />   → certificates are based on the name of the server<br />   → a wildcard domain will apply to all server names in a domain<br />   → *.professormesser.com<br /><br />Self-signed certificates<br />- internal certificates don't need to be signed by a public CA<br />   → your company is the only one going to use it<br />   → no need to purchase trust for devices that already trust you<br />- build your own CA<br />   → issue your own certificates signed by your own CA<br />- install the CA certificate / trusted chain on all devices<br />   → they'll now trust any certificates signed by your internal CA<br />   → works exactly like a certificate you purchased<br /><br />Machine and computer certificates<br />- you have to manage many devices<br />   → often devices that you'll never physically see<br />- how can you truly authenticate a device?<br />   → put a certificate on the device that you signed<br />- other business processes rely on the certificate<br />   → access to the remote access VPN from authorized devices<br />   → management software can validate the end device<br /><br />User certificates<br />- associate a certificate with a user<br />   → a powerful electronic “id card”<br />- use as an additional authentication factor<br />   → limit access without the certificate<br />- integrate onto smart cards<br />   → use as both a physical and digital access card<br /><br />Email certificates<br />- use cryptography in an email platform<br />   → you'll need public key cryptography<br />- encrypting emails<br />   → use a recipient's public key to encrypt<br />- receiving encrypted emails<br />   → use your private key to decrypt<br />- digital signatures<br />   → use your private key to digitally sign an email<br />   → non-repudiation, integrity<br /><br />Code signing certificate<br />- developers can provide a level of trust<br />   → applications can be signed by the developer<br />- the user's OS will examine the signature<br />   → checks the developer signature<br />   → validates that the software has not been modified<br />- is it from a trusted entity?<br />   → the user will have the opportunity to stop the application execution<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
