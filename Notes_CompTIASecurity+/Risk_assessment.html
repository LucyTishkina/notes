In Montana? In Florida?<br />- SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)<br />   → what is the monetary loss if a single event occurs?<br />   → Laptop stolen (asset value) = $1000<br />- ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy)<br />   → ARO x SLE<br />   → 7 laptops stolen a year (ARO) x $1000 (SLE) = $7000 <br />- the business impact can be more than monetary<br />   → quantitative vs qualitative<br /><br />Evaluating risk<br />- risk register<br />   → every project has a plan, but also has risk<br />   → identify and document the risk associated with each step<br />   → apply possible solutions to the identified risks<br />   → monitor the results<br />- supply chain assessment<br />   → get a product or service from supplier to customer<br />   → evaluate coordination between groups<br />   → identify areas of improvement<br />   → assess the IT systems supporting the operation<br />   → document the business process changes<br /><br />Qualitative risk assessment<br />- identify significant risk factors<br />   → ask opinions about the significance<br />   → display visually with traffic light grid or similar method<br /><br />Risk Factor                   Impact             ARO      Cost of Controls     Overall Risk<br />Legacy Windows              Y                    R                  Y                         R<br />Clients<br /><br />Untrained                         G                   Y                   G                        Y<br />staff<br /><br />No anti-virus                     Y                   R                   Y                         R<br />software<br /><br />Business impact analysis<br />- what are your critical business functions?<br />   → define the important business objectives<br />- what is impacted?<br />   → loss of revenue, legal requirements, customer service<br />- how long will you be impacted?<br />   → you'll need personnel, equipment, resources<br />- what's the impact to the bottom line?<br />   → is disaster recovery a good investment?<br /><br />Testing for risk<br />- many servers contain sensitive data<br />   → personal information, financial details, healthcare, etc.<br />- running vulnerability and penetration tests can cause outages<br />   → you can't predict how a system will react<br />- formal authorization is a best practice<br />   → remove all legal liability from the testing<br />   → vulnerability scanning is not very invasive<br />   → penetration testing can install backdoors, perform DDoS attacks transfer sensitive data, and more<br /><br />Risk response techniques<br />- risk-avoidance<br />   → stop participating in high-risk activity<br />- transference<br />   → buy some insurance<br />- acceptance<br />   → a business decision; we'll take the risk!<br />- mitigation<br />   → decrease the risk level<br />      ⇒ invest in security systems<br /><br />Change management<br />- how to make a change<br />   → upgrade software, change firewall configuration, modify switch ports<br />- one of the most common risks in the enterprise<br />   → occurs very frequently<br />- often overlooked or ignored<br />   → did you feel that bite?<br />- have clear policies<br />   → frequency, duration, installation process, fallback procedures<br />- sometimes extremely difficult to implement<br />   → it's hard to change corporate culture<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
