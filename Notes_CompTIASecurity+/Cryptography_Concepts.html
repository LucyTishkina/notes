<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Cryptography Concepts</h1><br/>Cryptography<br />- Greek “kryptos”<br />   → hidden, secret<br />- confidentiality<br />   → it's a secret<br />- authentication and access control<br />   → I know it's you. I REALLY know it's you.<br />- non-repudiation<br />   → You said it. You can't deny it.<br />- integrity<br />   → tamper-proof<br /><br />Cryptography terms<br />- plaintext<br />   → an unenctrypted message (in the clear)<br />- ciphertext<br />   → an encrypted message<br />- cipher<br />   → the algorithm used to encrypt and/or decrypt<br />- cryptanalysis<br />   → the art of cracking encryption<br />   → researchers are constantly trying to find weaknesses in ciphers<br />      ⇒ a mathematically flawed cipher is bad for everyone<br /><br />Cryptographic keys<br />- keys<br />   → add the key to the cypher to encrypt<br />   → larger keys are generally more secure<br />- some encryption methods use one key<br />   → some use more than one key<br />   → every method is a bit different<br /><br />Confusion<br />- encryption is based on confusion and diffusion<br />   → you need both<br />- confusion<br />   → the encrypted data is drastically different than the plaintext<br />   → the process should be non-linear, with no discernible patterns<br /><br />Diffusion<br />- change one character of the input, and many characters change of the output<br /><br />Security through obscurity<br />- security should exist, even if the attacker knows everything about the system<br />   → secrecy of the design shouldn't be the main method of security<br />   → encrytpion key would be the only unknown<br />- Substitution Cipher (Caesar cipher)<br />   → Substitute one letter with another<br />   → ROT13 - “URYYB” is “HELLO”<br />- if you know how the “security” is designed, you can circumvent it<br />   → SSID broadcast suppression, MAC filtering<br />   → security through obscurity<br /><br />Random numbers<br />- cryptography relies on randomness<br />   → used to generate keys, salt hashes, and much more<br />- random number generation<br />   → it's very difficult to create true randomness with a program<br />   → usually includes some type of natural input<br />   → mouse movements, atmospheric noise, lava lamp<br />- pseudo-randomness doesn't rely on the natural world<br />   → approximate true randomness<br />   → based on a starting seed<br /><br />App development and cryptography<br />- developers don't need to be cryptographers<br />   → they write to an API (application programming interface)<br />   → crypto modules<br />- the API library does all of the heavy lifting<br />   → send plaintext into the box, get ciphertext back<br />   → no extra programming required<br />- the Windows software library is the Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP)<br />   → the Microsoft CryptoAPI is the bridge between the application and the CSP<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
